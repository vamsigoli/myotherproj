//had we used the other way of building multi module project as given in the youtube examples
//using my-build-logic we could have made the plugins available to myotherproj also just by
//having pluginManagement section of myotherproj settings.gradle include the reference to the
//my-build-logic as includeBuild("../my-build-logic")

//for now, define the project group manually again
//this is required to refer to the shared-module as a dependency in the dependent projects
